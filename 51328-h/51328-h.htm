<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> the time of <span class="smcap">John Indagine</span>, who
published his “Art of Chiromancy” in 1563,
but little progress has been made in the study
of the hand as an indication of the physical
and mental peculiarities of the individual. In
our time, by the publication of the classical
work of Sir <span class="smcap">C. Bell</span> “On the Hand,” public
attention has been once more directed to the
form, structure, and uses of this important
organ.</p>

<p class="tb">The varieties in the structure and conformation
of the human hand which are met with
<span class="pagenum">iv</span>
in different individuals have recently been investigated
with much success, both in France
and Germany.</p>

<p class="tb">It is to <span class="smcap">D’Arpentigny</span>, a translation of whose
work<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> is now in course of publication in the
“Medical Times,” that we are indebted for
much of the information we possess as to the
mutual relation existing between particular
mental tendencies and certain definite forms of
hand. By Professor <span class="smcap">Carus</span>, of Dresden,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> the
views of <span class="smcap">D’Arpentigny</span> have been in part
verified, and at the same time considerably
extended. He has corrected much that was
erroneous, and endeavoured to establish a
science of <span class="smcap">Chirology</span>, founded upon the
anatomy and physiology of the hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum">v</span></p>
<p class="tb">I have availed myself freely of the materials
collected by <span class="smcap">D’Arpentigny</span> and <span class="smcap">Carus</span>, and
have modified, corrected, or omitted their
theories and statements when not in accordance
with my own experience. Much new
matter has been added, and the whole arranged
in a form which it is hoped may tend
somewhat to contribute either to the amusement
or instruction of the Reader.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“The form and posture of the human body, and its
various organs of perception, have an obvious reference
to man’s rational nature; and are beautifully fitted to
encourage and facilitate his intellectual improvement.”—<span class="smcap">Dugald
Stewart</span>, <cite>Moral Philosophy</cite>.</p></blockquote>

<h3>THE BRAIN THE ORGAN OF MIND.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the time of Thales and Pythagoras
to our own day the opinions of metaphysicians
have been divided with respect to
the mode in which ideas take their origin.
Some, with Descartes and Leibnitz, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
contended that the faculties of the mind are
innate—that is, that they originate solely
from within; while others, with Locke and
Condillac, affirm that they are acquired, and
in all cases derived, from impressions received
through the medium of the senses,—“Nihil
est in intellectu quod non prius
fuerit in sensu.”</p>

<p>However it may be with respect to this
controverted point, whether ideas originate
from without or from within, it is at least
certain that the manifestations of the mind,
far from being independent of, are, on the
contrary, closely linked and connected with,
the conditions of matter. Hippocrates, when
sent for by the Abderites to cure Democritus
of his supposed madness, found him busily
engaged in dissecting the brains of animals
for the purpose of ascertaining the organs
and causes of thought. That the brain is
the organ through which the manifestations
of mind are made known to us, was therefore
suspected by Democritus; and the accumulated
experience of centuries has rendered
that a certainty which with him was but a
mere conjecture. In the language of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
eloquent modern writer, “Where shall we
find proofs of the mind’s independence of
the bodily structure,—of that mind which,
like the corporeal frame, is infantile in the
child, manly in the adult, sick and debilitated
in disease, frenzied or melancholy in
the madman, enfeebled in the decline of life,
doting in decrepitude, and annihilated by
death?”</p>

<h3>MIND AND OUTWARD FORM IN HARMONY.</h3>

<p>Admitting, then, that the brain is the
organ of mind—the instrument by which we
are rendered cognisant of our own mental
operations and conceptions—it must be evident
that, for the purpose of making them
known to others, of carrying them into
effect, certain other parts become necessary,
the conception requiring instruments for its
execution. This important duty is intrusted
to the care of the senses, and for this reason
they have been correctly termed the hand-maidens
of the intellect, as it is through
their agency that the brain receives and
transmits impressions. Hence the manifestations
of mind are indicated and expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
by the outward form; for the senses can
act only through the medium of physical
organs, and with these latter the active
phenomena of life must necessarily be in
strict accordance. Thus, from the external
configuration of the body, or of some of its
parts, we can legitimately draw conclusions
respecting the degree and kind of mental
power. Let us examine this proposition a
little more in detail. In his <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Instauratio
Magna</cite>, Bacon relates that “when he was
a young man at Poictiers in France, he conversed
familiarly with a certain Frenchman,
a witty young man, but something talkative,
who afterwards grew to be a very eminent
man. He was wont to inveigh against the
manners of old men, and would say, that if
their minds could be seen as their bodies
are, they would appear no less deformed;
he would also maintain that the vices of old
men’s minds have some correspondence and
were parallel to the putrefaction of their
bodies. For the dryness of their skin, he
would bring in impudence; for the hardness
of their bowels, unmercifulness; for the lippitude
of their eyes, an evil eye and envy; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the casting down of their eyes and bowing
their bodies toward the earth, atheism (for,
saith he, they look no more up to heaven as
they were wont); for the trembling of their
members, irresolution of their decrees and
light inconstancy; for the bending of their
fingers, as it were to catch, rapacity and
covetousness; for the buckling of their
knees, fearfulness; for their wrinkles, craftiness
and obliquity.”</p>

<p>Now, without hoping to attain to the nice
discrimination of this ingenious young gentleman,
we shall attempt to elucidate a few
general facts connected with this part of our
subject.</p>

<p>With that spirit of observation for which
they were so eminently remarkable, the
ancients had long since remarked the constant
connexion of certain peculiarities of
outward form with particular modes of
thinking—a correspondence between the
physical and mental condition. It was in
accordance with this view that Galen founded
his celebrated doctrine of temperaments.
His distinction of the sanguine, phlegmatic,
choleric, and melancholic temperaments, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
based upon the notion of the Greek philosophers,
that there were four primary constituents
of the human body corresponding to
the four supposed elements of nature, and
that the presence of the one or the other of
these elements in excess occasioned the production
of the different temperaments. According
to the definition of the able physiologist
Müller, the temperaments are peculiar,
permanent conditions, or modes of mutual
reaction of the mind and organism, and they
are chiefly dependent on the relation which
subsists between the strivings or emotions of
the mind and the excitable structure of the
body. Even if we may be disposed to contend
that they are not absolutely <em>dependent</em>
on any particular constitution of the body, it
must still be conceded that they are at least
<em>associated</em> with certain peculiarities of outward
organisation, by which they may be
readily recognised; so that the physical
structure, the mental tendency, and the character
of ideas, are always intimately connected.
Thus persons of a sanguine or sensitive
temperament are, for the most part, of
moderate stature and <em>embonpoint</em>, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
smiling florid countenance, and light or
chestnut hair. Their ideas, like their physiognomy,
are all <em>couleur de rose</em>. Endowed
with great excitability, they are easily moved;
but impressions are not durable, giving place
quickly to other and newer emotions. Hence
their life is made up of transitions—now
grave, now gay; now happy, now miserable:
their feelings are perpetually changing, and
impressions made upon their mobile minds
become soon obliterated by some fresh object
of attention.</p>

<p>The phlegmatic, or elementary temperament,
is characterised by a persistence during
adult existence of the physical structure
proper to early life. The body is loaded
with cellular tissue and fat; the muscles are
large, but soft, and with indistinct outlines;
the countenance is pale; the physiognomy
but little marked, and the features not
sharply defined. Such persons are unexcitable,
their sensations are dull, and the
modes of reaction which they determine slow
and apathetic; their ideas are clear, but
they possess neither the quickness of conception
and imagination of persons of the san<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>guine,
nor the energy of action and strong
passions of those of the choleric temperament.
They love repose, and excel in occupations
which demand patience and attention,
of which they are possessed in a remarkable
degree.</p>

<p>In individuals of the choleric, or motive
temperament, the bony frame-work of the
body is strong and much developed; the
articulations are large and prominent;
the muscles firm, with but little cellular
tissue and fat; the physiognomy decided,
with sharply-chiselled features. Such individuals
are remarkable for promptitude and
energy of action; impetuous, passionate, and
endowed with great determination, opposition
only increases their endurance, and
excites a proportionate effort to conquer it.
In nature these temperaments are not frequently
encountered pure and free from
admixture, but mostly more or less mixed
the one with the other. That must be held
to be the most perfect temperament in which
they are all blended in such proportions that
neither is in excess; “in which moderate
excitability is combined with a due amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
of energy of action; in which imagination is
tempered by reason, and the ideas and conceptions
are regulated by judgment, and rectified
by reflection.” Impressions thus do
not react upon all in the same manner. In
some they are like figures traced upon the
sand of the sea-shore, which are obliterated
by the first advancing wave; they pass away
together with the ideas to which they give
rise, without leaving any, even the slightest
evidence, of their existence. In others they
are as characters deeply graven upon metal;
arousing the attention with an irresistible
force, they enchain and captivate the faculties,
ceasing but to leave behind them a
powerful and lasting impression upon the
mind.</p>

<h3>EFFECTS OF AGE, SEX, CLIMATE, ETC.
UPON MIND.</h3>

<p>By age, sex, locality, climate, and regimen
the mental operations are likewise powerfully
influenced. By locality and climate we
do not mean air and temperature merely, but
the sum total of all influences, whether physical
or moral, by which in every place we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
are surrounded. The bodily structure is
undoubtedly and materially influenced by
climate. Of this the modern Hungarians
afford a most convincing proof—a race of
people of a fine physical conformation, and
yet, as their language and traditions attest,
derived from the same stock as the barbarous,
deformed Ostiaks inhabiting the Uralian
Chain, to whom, as we learn from
history, they bore no slight resemblance,
on their arrival in the countries in which
they are at present located. Climate may
thus affect the mind in two ways, by modifying
the structure of the body, and by the
more direct action which it exerts upon the
mind itself; and it is to these two causes
that we must ascribe the differences in the
form and habits, the government and laws,
the superstitions and literature, of northern
and southern nations.</p>

<p>To differences and modifications of structure
constantly correspond differences and
modifications in ideas and passions. The
physical form and intellectual qualities are
closely and mutually connected. Thus,
one individual may excel another in a given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
pursuit, this excellence resulting rather from
a peculiar aptitude for, than from a particular
devotion to, its cultivation.</p>

<p>This aptitude, in many cases at least, is
to be mainly referred to some peculiarity of
structure in one or more of the organs of the
senses; it is original, and without the particular
organic conformation could never
have been acquired by centuries of practice
and experience.</p>

<h3>BODILY SUFFERING DEPENDENT UPON ORGANISATION
OF NERVOUS SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>To differences in the degree of sensibility
of the nervous system, together with the
varying amount of the peripheral ramifications
distributed to the external surface,
must be ascribed the different amount of
suffering experienced upon the application
of inordinate stimuli to the nerves. The
will is undoubtedly capable of exerting very
great control over the manifestations of feeling
called forth by such painful impressions
upon sentient nerves. Of this Roman history
affords us many notable examples. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
it seems probable that the Romans were not
endowed with a nervous system so delicately
organised as that of the more highly civilised
Greeks; witness the general structure
of their language and their comparative
inferiority in the fine arts. Neither heroism,
nor philosophy, nor even religion, can
prevent some organisations from exhibiting
manifestations of great pain from impressions
upon nerves, which in others would
occasion but a moderate amount of suffering;
a physical necessity compels them to
manifest evidences of intense feeling; and
thus, by a rude shock inflicted upon the
nervous system, a mathematician may be at
once recalled from the contemplation of
other spheres, or a metaphysician from the
most sublime speculations on the nature and
essence of the Deity.</p>

<p>In the lowest grades of society the general
nervous sensibility is mostly obtuse; in the
highest, on the contrary, it is frequently
morbidly acute: in the one case the mental
manifestations are dull and obscure; in the
other they may be brilliant, but are frequently
wanting in strength and energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>In his treatise on tropical diseases, Dr.
Mosely observes, that “Negroes are void of
sensibility to a surprising degree. They are
not subject to nervous diseases. They sleep
soundly in every disease, nor does any
mental disturbance ever keep them awake.
They bear chirurgical operations much
better than white people; and what would
be the cause of insupportable pain to a white
man, a Negro would almost disregard. I
have amputated the legs of many Negroes,
who have held the upper part of the limb
themselves.”</p>

his thoughts. Among mankind in
general the countenance may, with equal
force, be said to represent a series of hieroglyphics
by which the internal emotions of the
mind may be readily deciphered. Observe
a child thrown for the first time among a
number of strangers. To some it will immediately,
and as it were instinctively, attach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
itself, while to others it will manifest the
greatest repugnance and dislike. Such first
impressions are not the result of reasoning,
they spring from the quickness of perception
peculiar to childhood; and the choice is in
general not the less happy, although the
reason may have had no effect in determining
it. With a rapid glance a mere
infant will seize the prevailing expression of
the physiognomy, and detect at once the
mental constitution of those by whom it is
surrounded; for pride and impatience, and
kindness and benevolence, are written on
the plastic countenance in broad legible characters,
though the many, with their blunted
perceptions, may, to a certain extent, have
lost the key to their solution. Contrast the
expression of the physiognomy of some of
the more celebrated among the ancients, as
exemplified in the collection of antique busts
preserved in the museum of the Capitol at
Rome. Compare the broad open brow and
finely-chiselled features of Trajan, or the
beauty, majesty, and grace expressed in the
countenance of either of the Antonines, with
the coarse, heavy, animal face of Vitellius, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the dull, morose expression of Caligula or
of Commodus,—</p>

<div class="line i5">————“Without a ray</div>
<div class="line">Of mind, that makes each feature play</div>
<div class="line">Like sparkling waves on a sunny day.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The difference is as striking as that which
we know from daily observation to exist
between the face of a rogue and that of an
honest man; indeed, we are disposed to
believe, with Benjamin Franklin, “that if
rogues knew the advantages attached to the
practices of the virtues, they would become
honest men from mere roguery.” It was for
this reason, probably, that beauty of form and
proportion were so highly prized by the ancients;
and when they prayed the gods to
grant them the beautiful with the good, was
it not because by experience they had found
that in fact they were most frequently associated?
In support of this position, we may
cite the authority of Bacon, who, in his
Essay on Beauty, remarks, “that Augustus
Cæsar, Titus Vespasianus, Philip le Bel of
France, Edward IV. of England, Alcibiades
of Athens, and Ismael the sophi of Persia,
were all high and great spirits, and yet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
most beautiful men of their time.” Again,
the physiognomy of the passions affords us
further proof that the emotions of the mind
betray themselves by peculiar corporeal phenomena,—each
having, as it were, its own
proper dialect. Notice the expression of the
passions which follow each other in such
quick succession, and are so forcibly depicted
upon the mobile countenance of an
infant, even before any voluntary movements
can be executed by the feeble and powerless
limbs. Look at a coward, his countenance
blanched, and almost cadaverous,—the heavy
limbs drooping and powerless,—the instruments
of life paralysed, as though the
fountain of existence were suddenly dried up.
For grief, take the testimony of Byron,
where he describes its effects in producing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i05">“The intersected lines of thought,—</div>
<div class="line">Those furrows which the burning share</div>

<div class="line">Scars of the lacerated mind</div>
<div class="line">Which the soul’s war doth leave behind.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Regard a man under the influence of a
sublime or heroic thought, with his head
proudly elevated and nostrils dilated,—he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
raises himself to his utmost height; while,
at the idea of infinity, or the prospect of a
boundless expanse, the arms are involuntarily
extended as though he would soar away into
unlimited space. The impress of pride is
stamped in the bold erect bearing, and that
of fear in the drooping head and timid step.
So true is it that joy and sorrow, love and
hate, pain and pleasure, virtue and vice, all
betray themselves by their organic signs,
that when any of these affections are habitual,
or frequently recur, their external manifestations
become permanently marked in
the form; and it is in this sense that the
habits and emotions of early youth stamp the
lineaments with a character never to be
effaced, or which, in <em>many cases</em> at least,
are destined to endure through life. Are
we not then justified in concluding, that the
kind and degree of mental developement,—the
presiding thought,—the ruling and predominating
principle of life, is influenced by
the physical temperament and constitution,
and that this latter is in its turn reacted
upon by the mind?</p>

<h3>PARTICULAR PARTS OF ORGANISM INDICATIVE
OF MODE OF LIFE AND MENTAL
TENDENCY.</h3>

<p>We have next to inquire, whether that
which is undoubtedly true with respect to
the whole does not also obtain with respect
to a part? whether, in fact, from the examination
of a small portion of an organism—an
extremity, for example—we should be
enabled to determine the nature, mode of
life, and mental tendency of the being to
which it belonged? For a satisfactory solution
of this important question we must
appeal to the testimony afforded by the
animal world.</p>

<h3>CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN FORMS AND
HABITS OF ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>The most simple observation renders at
once apparent a correspondence between the
external form of animals, the general direction
of their tendencies, and their habits.</p>

<p>Let us examine this question at somewhat
greater length. From the age of Aristotle
to the present time, zoologists have arranged
the almost countless tribes of animals into a
number of groups or divisions, more or less
related in general habits and structure. All
the classifications which have been hitherto
proposed may be referred to one or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
other of two general principles. Either the
colour of the blood (Aristotle), the conformation
of the heart (Hunter), the arrangement
of the nervous system (Owen), or some
other peculiarity of <em>internal</em> structure, has
been selected as the basis of arrangement;
or the animal creation has been grouped
according to certain definite circumstances
connected with outward form and configuration.
As regards their internal organisation,
the variations in the structure and
arrangement of the nervous system affords by
far the best means of classifying animals,
and the whole animal world has accordingly
been divided into five primary divisions. We
have already endeavoured to prove that
the manifestations of mind are only made
known to us through the medium of corporeal
organs, whatever may be the nature
of its essence. By the state of the nervous
system volition is modified or controlled, the
operation of the senses accelerated or retarded,
the muscular movements rendered
feeble and uncertain, or strong, vigorous, and
energetic; in fine, the chief manifestations
of life, thought, volition, and independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
motion, are all regulated by the condition
and structure of the central nervine masses.</p>

<h3>APPENDAGES TO THE TRUNK A KEY TO THE
ENTIRE ORGANISATION AND HABITS
OF ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>The appendages to the trunk, like the
arrangement of the nervous system, furnish
also a leading peculiarity of structure, and
they may be selected as the basis of a classification
founded upon outward form. For
the most part, destined either for the purposes
of locomotion, or to assist in the procuring
of food, they must of necessity be in
perfect accordance with the nervous and
nutritive systems. Hence the capacities,
powers, and general habits of an animal,
must be in correspondence with this part of
its organisation; so that when we are acquainted
with the form and arrangement of
the extremities of an animal, a key is thereby
afforded to its entire organisation. Both its
external configuration, its mode of life, and
its internal structure, must harmonise, and
be in accordance with the arrangement of
the extremities. Its breathing and vascular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
apparatus, its nutritive and generative systems,
are thus all indicated to us; and from
a knowledge of one particular we may safely
and surely predicate the nature of the rest.</p>

<p><i>Annelida.</i>—Thus in the worms (<i>Annelida</i>),
creatures exhibiting but few of the
higher manifestations of life, we find the appendages
to the trunk in their simplest form,—that
of fine, minute bristles attached to
the several rings or segments of the body.
In the sea-mouse (<i>Aphrodita</i>), their bristles
attain a somewhat higher developement, each
of them being connected with a distinct elevation,
or mammillary process, with which it
is, as it were, articulated.</p>

<p><i>Myriapoda.</i>—In the Centipedes, the first
evidence of a well-formed extremity makes its
appearance in the form of numerous articulated
legs terminated by simple points.
These legs, rudimentary in the lowest species
(<i>Iulidæ</i>), in harmony with their retiring
habits and vegetable diet, are divided into
distinct joints, and provided with proper
muscles, in the strong and carnivorous varieties
(<i>Scolopendridæ</i>). In these latter
animals, the ventral nervous ganglia are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
increased in size, in a ratio proportioned to
the higher and more complex structure of
the appendages to the trunk.</p>

<p><i>Insects.</i>—In insects, creatures distinguished
by so many and such admirable
instincts, and endowed with such active
powers of locomotion, the appendages to the
body, both legs and wings, are perfectly and
beautifully formed. The former, six in
number, are attached to the three first thoracic
segments of the body, composed of
distinct articulations, connected by ligaments
and muscles, and furnished with a series of
minute breathing tubes, or tracheal ramifications,
extending throughout their entire
substance. The latter—the wings—vary
much in their number, form, and arrangement;
and it is upon characters furnished
by them that the nearest approximation to
a perfect classification of insects—that of
Burmeister—is based. Thus, the legs are
typical of the class, the wings characterise
the orders.</p>

<p><i>Arachnida.</i>—In the spider tribe (<i>Arachnida</i>)
the legs, in their general structure,
resemble those of insects; but they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
eight in number, and, in addition to them,
these creatures are provided with remarkable
claw-like appendages to their jaws—mere
organs of feeling in the mites, but
strong and powerful instruments of prehension
in the scorpion tribe.</p>

<p><i>Crustacea.</i>—The crab and lobster tribe
(<i>Crustaceans</i>) are likewise accurately characterised
by the appendages to the trunk,
the number and disposition of these parts
having been employed by Milne Edwards
for the purpose of dividing these creatures
into a number of orders.</p>

<p><i>Mollusca.</i>—Among the mollusks, the
classes are nearly all named from the peculiarities
in form or the position of the feet.
We have the barnacles (<i>Cirrhopoda</i>), animals
with six pair of articulated flexible
arms, composed of a series of small pieces
studded with minute hairs, and which form,
when they are extended, a species of net
by means of which the animal catches its
prey. The <i>Branchiopoda</i>—creatures such
as the <i>Terebratula</i>—with two long fleshy
arms placed near the mouth, which are
hollow, muscular, and disposed in spiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
folds. We have the <i>Tunicata</i>, such as
<i>Ascidians</i> and the <i>Conchifera</i>, as the
oyster and mussel, beings which are destitute
of members, and all but incapable of
locomotion. The <i>Gasteropoda</i>, of which the
slug and snail afford familiar examples, and
that are furnished with a locomotive apparatus
peculiar to the whole class, and
termed the foot or ventral disc. The <i>Pteropoda</i>,
nearly allied to the <i>Gasteropoda</i> in
their internal organisation, but differing
from them in the possession of two broad
fleshy expansions, resembling fins, which
are attached to the side of the neck, and
are well adapted for swimming. And, lastly,
we have the <i>Cephalopoda</i>, such as the nautilus
and cuttle-fish, creatures with numerous
strong muscular arms attached around
the head, and in some species provided with
sucking discs, by means of which they are
enabled successfully to attack and capture
the strongest and most active prey. In all
these instances we clearly see that the appendages
characterise the class, and that,
from an acquaintance with their number and
arrangement, a naturalist could readily come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
to a conclusion as to the affinities, structure,
and general habits of any animal in the
series.</p>

<p><i>Fishes.</i>—The fishes are divided into two
great natural orders—those furnished with
a bony skeleton and those in which the
framework of the body is cartilaginous. The
former division are distinguished by the
possession of a swimming bladder, and by
the nearly equal developement of the parts
corresponding to the extremities—the pectoral
and ventral fins. The pectoral fins,
situated immediately behind the head, are
present in all the osseous fishes, traces of
them being found even where they might be
supposed to be entirely wanting, as in the
eel; they do not, however, attain any very
considerable size, rarely equalling, and never
surpassing, the magnitude of the ventral
fins. In the cartilaginous fishes, on the
contrary, not only in those which ordinarily
remain quiet at the bottom of the water,
as the skate, the sole, the flounder, and
other flat fishes, but even in the active and
voracious sharks we find no swimming-bladder.
In these cases, its place is sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>plied
and its duty performed by the enormously
developed anterior member or pectoral
fin, which greatly surpasses the ventral
fin in size; and it is by means of the active
movements of this large hand that these
creatures raise themselves from the bottom
of the water to the surface.</p>

<p><i>Reptiles.</i>—In the class of reptiles the
characters afforded by the form of the extremities
are not less important. Of the
four orders into which this class is divided,
one—that of the serpents (<i>Ophidia</i>)—is
altogether destitute of members, with the
exception of the rudimentary traces of extremities
met with in some few species
(<i>Anguis</i>, <i>Bimanes</i>, and <i>Seps</i>). In another
order, that of amphibious animals (<i>Batrachia</i>),
as the frogs, toads, &amp;c., the extremities
are still typical of certain peculiarities
of organisation. Some of these
creatures may be said to remain in an imperfectly
developed or embryonic condition
during their whole existence. Instead of
breathing in adult life by means of lungs,
as do the more perfectly organised of the
<i>batrachia</i>, they retain throughout existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
that peculiar structure of the respiratory apparatus—the
branchial tufts—which in the
latter are present but in the embryo condition.
In those of the amphibious animals
which breathe by means of permanent branchia
(<i>Perenni-branchiata</i>), such as the <i>Lepidosiren</i>
and the <i>Proteus</i>, the extremities
are either mere filamentary appendages, or
at most but very imperfectly-formed organs,
and always typical of their comparatively
inferior organisation; while, in the higher
species, that is, those provided with lungs,
and losing their branchiæ in the adult state
(<i>Caduci-branchiata</i>), as the frog, the salamander, &amp;c.,
the extremities are well formed
and perfectly developed. The third order of
reptiles—that of the lizard tribe (<i>Sauria</i>)—is
made up of members very dissimilar
both in their appearance and general habits.
In the aquatic crocodiles the toes are connected
by means of a membrane; like ducks
and other aquatic animals, these creatures
are web-footed. The alligator, so nearly
allied to the crocodile in structure and habits,
with the exception that it is more terrestrial
in its nature, is furnished with a foot the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
toes of which are only webbed in half their
length, the other half being free and unconnected
by membrane, their amphibious
mode of life being indicated by their foot.
If we compare the foot of these creatures
with that of the true lizards, the difference
of structure will be found to be considerable.
The foot of the true lizard is provided with
five toes to both the fore and hind members,
while attached to the hinder members of
crocodiles and alligators we find but four
toes. The toes of the lizard are not connected
by a membrane, but are separate,
and armed with nails, for these creatures
live on land, and have need of well-constructed
locomotive organs to enable them
to catch their active prey. Among lizards,
that remarkable animal the chameleon, that
is provided with a particular structure of
the skin, whereby its change of colour is
effected, is distinguished by the possession
of a member, the structure of which is not
less peculiar. The toes are arranged in
two packets, which are capable of being
brought into opposition—a structure admirably
adapted to the mode of life of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
animal—the climbing of trees and shrubs in
pursuit of insects. The ichthyosaurus and
plesiosaurus, creatures of the lizard tribe
which have now become extinct, are both
characterised by the form of their extremities.
The former has four members like
paddles, each composed of nearly a hundred
small bones of an irregular polygonal shape
and arranged in a pavement-like form. The
latter has also four paddle-shaped extremities,
but the number of bones of which each
is composed is much less than in the ichthyosaurus—not
above fifty, the pieces being at
the same time of a different shape, and not
arranged in a tessellated form.</p>

<p><i>Birds.</i>—Among birds the foot is a most
important organ, serving at once for support,
prehension, and locomotion. Its modifications
are accordingly very numerous, and
ornithologists have employed the characters
presented by it as a basis of classification.
Scopoli, in his Introduction to Natural History
(1777), proposed a systematic distribution of
birds into two divisions founded upon the
form of the scales covering the foot; thus,
some are furnished with scales, small and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
polygonal (<i>Retepedes</i>), while others (<i>Scutipedes</i>)
have the legs covered in front with
unequal semicircular plates. So, again, in
the division of birds proposed by Nitzsch,
viz. into the aerial, terrestrial, and aquatic,
the foot will at once serve to indicate the
different orders. We will proceed to examine
the special characters afforded by the
foot of birds in each of the groups or orders,
adopting the classification of Kirby, one of
the most recent.</p>

<p>In the first order, the birds of prey (<i>Raptores</i>),
which includes the eagle, the vulture,
the owl, &amp;c., for the purpose of striking
their quarry, and of securing it by a firm
grasp, a strong muscular foot is necessary,
and we consequently find that the foot is
provided with four short muscular toes,
three placed before, and one behind, all
armed with long, sharp, hooked talons, those
of the thumb and innermost toe being the
longest, as the great duty of grasping is
mainly performed by them. The claws are
also capable of being drawn back, they are
retractile like those of the cat; and the
scales upon the upper surface of the foot, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
well as the skin covering it below, are strong
and tough for the purpose of protecting
the member from the attacks of the living
prey upon which these creatures feed. The
foot is also broadly marked, the kind of
marking and the size of the scales being especially
characteristic of the different genera
and families. In the vultures, which from
their feeding on carrion do not require such
strength of foot, we find a notable deviation
from this general character, the toes
becoming longer and slighter and the claws
much weaker.</p>

<p>In the second order of birds, the perchers
(<i>Passeres</i> of Linnæus), which comprehends
sparrows, thrushes, larks, &amp;c., the
foot is constructed for another and a very
different purpose. Its chief office is to support
the bird in a horizontal position upon
the boughs and branches of trees and shrubs;
hence the foot is long, the toes slender, very
flexible, and armed with long, straight, weak
claws, which are not at all retractile. All
the birds of this order possess four toes, one
of which, the hind toe (<i>hallux</i>), is placed
straight out behind, the others being in front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
and those situated externally are connected
to the middle ones at their bases. The
scales covering the foot are regularly disposed,
and as they are not needed for the
purpose of defence, they are thin and tender,
resembling ordinary scarf skin. Even in the
shrikes,—the birds of prey of this order, who
feed upon living creatures and use the foot
for securing them, the claws are not sharp,
nor is the foot formed in such a manner as to
ensure a very secure grasp, and we accordingly
find that they merely press this organ
upon their prey for the purpose of holding
it. In a few other families of this order, as
the todies, the kingfishers, &amp;c., the foot is
called upon to assist in feeding, and we consequently
find certain modifications of structure
indicative of this office. In order to
strengthen the foot and to secure a firmer
grasp, the external and middle toes are
united almost to the apex, and the strength
of the hind toe is considerably increased.</p>

<p>In the third order, the climbers (<i>Scansores</i>),
or, as they have been sometimes
termed, the yoke-footed, to which the woodpecker
and the parrot tribe belong, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
structure of the foot is modified for the important
purpose of enabling the creature to
support itself in all positions upon the stems
and branches of trees. In order to effect
this the foot is made strong, short, and muscular,
the claws sharp and curved, and the
toes are placed in a very different position
to that which they occupy in other orders,
two of them being situated in front and two
behind. By such a disposition, a strong,
secure grasp is afforded; and thus it is that
most birds belonging to this order are enabled
to climb in a vertical position, and to
effect movements like animals of the monkey
tribe. In general these birds move very
awkwardly upon a level surface, but in one
or two species the structure of the foot is so
modified that they can run upon the ground
with great speed. This is the case with the
travellers’ friend of South America, and with
the ground parrot of New South Wales; and
these creatures have accordingly slender toes
so constructed, that one of the two placed
behind can be brought in front at will, so
that a larger and more secure basis of support
is thus afforded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>In the fourth order the scratchers (<i>Rasores</i>),
to which the common fowl, the pheasant,
and the pigeon belong, the foot is
adapted for an instrument of active locomotion,
as well as for the purpose of procuring
food by scratching in the earth. Hence we
find it strong, with a long muscular leg, and
four toes, three before and one behind, covered
with broad scales and armed with
short claws. The thumb, so necessary for
perching and climbing, is in birds of this
order short, rudimentary, and attached high
up in the leg, so that the whole foot being
placed flat upon the ground, affords a very
firm support to the animal.</p>

<p>In the fifth order of birds, the runners
(<i>Cursores</i>), to which the ostrich, the emu,
and the cassowary belong, the structure of
the foot is wholly that of a powerful instrument
of locomotion. The leg is long, the
thigh strong and muscular, and the foot
short and compact. The toes which never
exceed two or three in number, and of which
the second is the largest, are placed all in
front, and armed with very short claws, or,
as in the African ostrich, with the outer toe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
destitute of a claw. The scales are limited
to the upper surface of the foot, the under
surface being flexible and occupied by an
elastic pad upon which the member rests.
Such a conformation of limb, which would
be wholly useless for perching or climbing,
is admirably fitted for running—witness the
swiftness of the ostrich—a creature equalling
and even surpassing the fleetest horse in
speed.</p>

<p>In the sixth order, the waders (<i>Grallatores</i>),
or stilt birds, as the stork, the crane,
the heron, &amp;c., the leg is long and slender,
and the foot weak and covered with shield-shaped
scales. The toes, four in number,
are long and straight, three being placed
anteriorly, and a shorter one (wanting in the
plovers and lapwings) behind; they are
frequently palmated at their base, as in the
stork; or, as in the middle claw of the heron,
toothed or notched like a saw; while sometimes
they have a narrow-winged appendage,
running along the side, as in the sandpipers.
In search of their food, insects and small fish,
the individuals of this order frequent marshy
places and shallow waters, and many of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
as the stork and heron, are remarkable for
the unerring certainty with which they strike
and seize their small finny prey.</p>

<p>In the last order, the swimmers (<i>Natatores</i>),
called also web-footed birds, to which
the goose, duck, and gull belong, the foot is
modified to assist in swimming. The legs
are short; the four toes, all placed in front,
are united by a broad membranous expansion,
and armed with claws, the thumb being
likewise brought in front, so that a greater
extent of surface may be given to this oar-like
member. A foot thus constructed would
be wholly unsuited for perching, running, or
grasping, but it is well adapted to the wants
and habits of these aquatic birds.</p>

<p><i>Mammals.</i>—It is but in animals who
suckle their young (<i>Mammalia</i>) that the
extremities attain their greatest state of
developement, and it is in the higher orders
alone that they become useful as organs of
prehension, their office being limited in most
of the lower tribes to support and locomotion.
In the lowest order of the series, or whale
tribe (<i>Cetacea</i>), the members, in the number
of pieces of which they are composed, bear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
considerable resemblance to the fins of fishes,
though they are somewhat differently constructed,
according as the animal may be
destined exclusively for an aquatic existence,
like the common sperm whale, or be more
or less herbivorous, and consequently terrestrial
in its habits, like the dugong. In the
former case, the extremities are converted
into broad paddles adapted for swimming,
and the feet are webbed; in the latter, the
members are better developed, the toes being
free, and furnished with nails at their termination.</p>

<p>Of those orders of <i>Mammalia</i> which are
provided with four members—the ordinary
quadrupeds—some are furnished with a foot
which appears to be entirely without toes,
their place being supplied by a mass of
horny tissue—the hoof. This is the case
with the ruminants—animals that chew the
cud—as the cow, and with the horse; but
in the latter, as the name of the order implies
(<i>Solidungula</i>), the hoof is solid, while in
the ruminants it is cleft; and hence by some
naturalists these latter animals have been
termed <i>Bisulca</i>. Some slight differences are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
perceptible in the construction of the feet of
ruminants: thus the chamois, the antelope,
and other of the deer tribe, are furnished
with an additional toe, which, projecting
backwards, affords a firmer support to the
body. In the thick-skinned animals (<i>Pachydermata</i>)
the toes can hardly be said to be
free, being still partially enclosed in the
tough skin. It is from characters afforded
by the foot that several tribes of animals
belonging to this order are mainly characterised:
thus the elephant has five toes to
each foot, the rhinoceros three, and the hog
and hippopotamus four. Among those of
the mammalia which are characterised by
the presence of four members with distinct
and separate toes and nails, but few are furnished
with a true hand—that is, a member
with a thumb capable of being brought into
apposition with the other fingers. Carnivorous
animals have either a foot with sharp
recurved and retractile claws, as the cat and
tiger, or with straight blunt claws, not retractile,
as the bear; or the feet are small,
almost completely enveloped in the skin, and
furnished with a membranous expansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
connecting the toes, as in the aquatic seal
and walrus, or river-horse: but in all these
animals, although the fore-legs may be more
or less employed as instruments of prehension,
they are not used for the purpose of
conveying food to the mouth. In some of
the gnawing animals, as the squirrel, the
anterior extremity commences to assume the
function of a hand; and in a few of the
kangaroo tribe, such as the opossum, the
hinder extremities are provided with a
thumb capable of being brought into apposition
with the other toes. The hand of
bats, which serves these animals not merely
for flying, but also supplies the place of eyes
and ears, enabling them to avoid objects
during the obscurity of night, is furnished
with a sense of touch extremely delicate. It
is in man and the monkey tribe only that we
meet with a true and perfect hand. In
the latter, both the fore and hind extremities
are constructed upon the same general
principle as the hand of man; and hence
these animals have been styled four-handed
(<i>Quadrumana</i>).</p>

<p>“In man the upper members are disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
in a manner the most favourable for the exercise
of their functions as organs of prehension
and of touch: the fingers are long and
flexible; they have all, with the occasional
exception of the ring-finger, separate movements,
which other animals (even those provided
with hands) have not; the thumb,
which is apposable to these latter, is longer
in proportion to the fingers than in monkeys,
and consequently can more readily apply
itself to the extremity of their palm or surface,
and better seize small objects. The
nails, which are large and flat, cover the
back part only of the extremity of the fingers,
so as to furnish a support to the organs of
touch without in the least depriving them of
their delicacy. The entire hand can execute
rotatory movements the most extended; and
to the arm which supports it is afforded a
solid attachment by means of a large shoulder
or blade-bone and a long collar-bone.” The
statement of Milne Edwards,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> then, does
not appear far removed from the truth,
“That the faculties of the <i>Mammalia</i> are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
more elevated in proportion as their members
are the better constructed for prehension and
for touch.”</p>

<h3>USE OF A KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORM OF APPENDAGES
TO TRUNKS IN GEOLOGY.</h3>

<p>A knowledge of the form of the appendages
to the trunk of animals is of great service
to the geologist, for it has been well and
truly said, that the organic remains imbedded
in rocks are as medals struck in
commemoration of the great revolutions
which the earth has undergone, and so
small a portion as the extremity of an animal
is sufficient to indicate its nature, and
to enable us to ascertain the class and order
to which it belongs. Let us take a few
examples. Some fossil bones were discovered
by General Washington near his
seat in Virginia. Mr. Jefferson, by whom
they were examined, stated that they had
belonged to an enormous carnivorous animal,
which from the size of its claws he named
the <i>Megalonyx</i>. Upon an examination more
carefully conducted by Cuvier, it was found
that in the paw the second bone of the toe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
was symmetrical, while in animal feeders
furnished with retractile claws it is curved,
and not symmetrical; the first bone, too, was
the shortest, whereas in the lion and others
of the feline tribe it is the longest. Whence
Cuvier was led to conclude that the creature
in question was a sloth of large dimensions,
which fed only upon plants.</p>

<p>Upon another occasion, from a careful
consideration of the form and size of a toe
found in the Palatinate, near Eppelsheim,
Cuvier was able to determine that the animal
to which it belonged was of the edentate
tribe of <i>Pangolins</i>. It was from an examination
of the hand that Cuvier decided upon
the nature of the <i>Pterodactylus</i>. This curious
animal partook of the nature of both
the reptile and the bird. Like the bird, it
was furnished with a long neck and a horny
beak, but in its jaws and teeth it resembled
the crocodile. It had not, however, like
the bird, feathered wings without fingers to
strengthen them, nor had it a wing in which
the thumb alone is free, like that of the bat.
Instead of the bony pieces of all the fingers
being equally prolonged, the second finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
only was extended to a great length, and
from it the wing spread out, the other fingers
being short and furnished with nails like the
toes of ordinary animals. Collini, its discoverer,
supposed it to be of marine origin;
Soemmerring contended that it was a mammal;
but its true place in the animal series
was first assigned to it by Cuvier, who has
satisfactorily shewn that it is in fact intermediate
between a bird and a reptile.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the form of the extremities
of animals has been of great service to palæontology
in another way—in proving the
existence of certain species of animals at
given periods of the earth’s formation, from
the print of their footsteps left upon the sand
or other material of the strata while it was
yet in a soft state. Such traces were first
observed by Dr. Duncan in Dumfries-shire.
On examining a sandstone quarry, he found
these prints not on one only, but on several
successive layers of the stone; so that they
must have been made at periods distant from
each other. Similar impressions have been
since observed in the Forest marble-beds
near Bath, at Hessburg in Saxony, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
State of Connecticut, and in some other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>“The marks found in Dumfries-shire, of
which there were as many as twenty-four
upon a single slab, formed as it were a regular
track, with six distinct repetitions of
each foot, the fore and hind feet having left
different impressions, and even the marks of
the claws being discernible. They appear
to have been made by some animal of the
tortoise kind. At Hessburg the impressions
were discovered in quarries of grey and red
sandstone alternating; and the marks were
both larger and more distinct than those
found in Scotland. In one the hind foot
measured twelve inches in length, and the
fore foot always appeared much smaller than
the hind. From this circumstance, and from
the distance between the two being only fourteen
inches, it is conjectured that the animal
was a marsupial like the kangaroo, and it
has been termed by Dr. Kaup <i>Chirotherium</i>,
from the supposed resemblance of the four
toes and turned-out thumb to a hand. In
the State of Connecticut, near Northampton,
footsteps differing exceedingly in size have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
been found in inclined strata of sandstone.
They were evidently made before it assumed
its present position. The marks are always
in pairs, and the tracts cross each other like
those of ducks on the margin of a muddy
pond. One is of the length of fifteen or sixteen
inches, and a feathery spur or appendage
appears to have been attached to the
heel, eight or nine inches long. The distance
between the steps is proportioned to
their length, but in every case the pace
appears to have been longer than that of the
existing species of birds to which they approach
nearest—the ostrich, and the animal
must consequently have been proportionably
larger. How much larger he was than the
ostrich may be gathered from this, that the
large African ostrich has only a foot ten
inches long, less than two-thirds that of this
bird, and yet stands nine feet high. These
proportions would give a height of fourteen
feet to the extinct animal.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The characters afforded by the foot have
recently enabled Mr. Strickland to deter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>mine
that the dodo, a bird now extinct, is
not related either to the gallinaceous birds,—the
vulture or the ostriches as some have
conjectured,—but is closely allied to the
pigeons.</p>

<p>From this cursory examination of the animal
world we may gather the important
conclusion, that from the structure of an
extremity we may obtain a complete insight
into the entire organisation of an animal;
and thus the paws furnished with sharp retractile
claws of the lion indicate at once
to a naturalist its strong teeth, its powerful
jaws, and its muscular strength of limb;
while from the cleft foot of the cow, the
complicated structure of its stomach, the
definite peculiarities of its jaws, and its
vegetable diet, may with equal certainty be
predicated.</p>

<p>Thus, as Paley justly observes, “In the
swan, the web foot, the spoon bill, the long
neck, the thick down, the graminivorous
stomach, have all a relation to one another,
inasmuch as they all concur in one design,
that of supplying the occasions of an aquatic
fowl, floating upon the surface of shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
parts of water, and seeking its food at the
bottom. Begin with any one of these peculiarities
of structure, and observe how the
rest follow it. The web foot qualifies the
bird for swimming, the spoon bill enables it
to graze. But how is an animal, floating
upon the surface of pools of water, to gaze at
the bottom except by the mediation of a
long neck? And a long neck is accordingly
given to it. Again, a warm-blooded animal,
which was to pass its life upon water, required
a defence against the coldness of that
element. Such a defence is furnished to the
swan in the muff in which its body is
wrapped. But all this outward apparatus
would have been in vain if the intestinal
system had not been suited to the digestion
of vegetable substances.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>And, again, of the mole: “The form of the
feet fixes the character of the animal. They
are so many shovels; they determine its
action to that of rooting in the ground; and
every thing about its body agrees with this
destination. The cylindrical figure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
mole, as well as the compactness of its form,
arising from the terseness of its limbs, proportionally
lessens its labour; because, according
to its bulk, it thereby requires the
least possible quantity of earth to be removed
for its progress. It has nearly the same
structure of the face and jaws as a swine,
and the same office for them. The nose is
sharp, slender, tendinous, strong; with a
pair of nerves going down to the end of it.
The plush covering, which, by the smoothness,
closeness, and polish of the short piles
that compose it, rejects the adhesion of almost
every species of earth, defends the
animal from cold and wet, and from the
impediment which it would experience by
the mould sticking to its body. From soils
of all kind the little pioneer comes forth
bright and clean. Inhabiting dirt, it is of
all animals the neatest.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“Some animals have horns, some have hoofs, some talons,
some claws, some spurs and beaks; man hath none of all
these, but is weak and feeble, and sent unarmed into the
world. Why?—a hand, with reason to rise it, supplies
the place of all these.”—<span class="smcap">Ray.</span></p></blockquote>

<h3>FORM OF EXTREMITIES DIFFERS IN INDIVIDUALS
OF THE SAME SPECIES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J. Barrow</span> states of the Hottentot
that there is not an animal among the numbers
that range the wilds of Africa, if he be
at all acquainted with it, the print of whose
foot he cannot distinguish. The print of
any of his companions’ feet he would single
out among a thousand. That particular
species of animals can be distinguished by
their feet appears, then, an undoubted fact;
and it is not less true than that modifications
in the form of the extremities are met with
among animals of the same species. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the male frog is distinguished from the
female by the presence of a more fully-developed
thumb and the addition of a velvety,
cushion-like substance to its outer surface,
by means of which he is enabled to grasp
the latter more securely, and ensure the
fecundation of the eggs. The land-frog
(<i>Hyla</i>) differs from the common frog (<i>Rana</i>)
in possessing a viscous disc at the extremity
of each toe, so that this animal can readily
mount the branches of trees in search of
prey. The courage of the falcon is estimated
by the form and disposition of the wing feathers,
and that of the fighting cock by the
conformation of his foot. But it is to the
hand of man,—the emblem of his vast superiority
over all the lower animals, that
we would more particularly invite attention.
The hand of man, like the appendages to
the trunk of animals, has a certain definite
relation with his whole organisation. As
Sir C. Bell observes, “The possession of an
instrument like the hand implies that there
must be a great part of the organisation
which strictly belongs to it concealed. The
hand is not a thing appended, or put on to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the body, like an additional movement in a
watch; but a thousand intricate relations
must be established throughout the whole
frame in connexion with it.”</p>

<p>The form of the hand, like that of the
entire body, is materially influenced by age,
sex, and race; and it is not less affected by
the particular kind of organisation, the
mental disposition, and the temperament
of the individual.</p>

<p><i>Age.</i>—In the minute germ, or embryo of
a month, the form of the hand resembles
that of one of the lower animals. It puts
on the appearance rather of a respiratory
organ than of an instrument of prehension,
and, being completely destitute of fingers,
presents a great analogy in form with the fin
of a fish. As the little being increases in
size, the fingers become gradually developed.
They at first appear as small bud-like projections
attached to the perfectly-formed
palm. By degrees the several pieces of the
fingers become more and more elongated,
and at length attain their perfect length and
shape; though, even at birth, the relative
size of the palm, compared with the fingers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
is considerably greater than in the adult.
During infancy and childhood the hand retains,
to a certain extent, the same character,
the hand of the child being soft and thick,
with a broad palm and short rudimentary
fingers. With the period of puberty it attains
its perfect developement, and acquires
characters which it preserves throughout
manhood. As old age creeps on the hand
loses its softness and pliancy, it becomes
hard and insensible, and its vigour, like that
of the mind, may be said to be gone. “Le
cal de la main, presque toujours, jette une
ombre sur l’esprit,” says D’Arpentigny. Politics,
science, literature—whatever active
intellectual pursuit the mind formerly delighted
in, commences at this period of life
to lose its former charm, to be succeeded by
a love of quiet rural occupation. In the
language of the author just quoted, “It is
when our stiffened hands, become, as it were,
ossified and nearly insensible, afford a faithful
image of our impoverished intelligence,
that we are the most ruled by this mania for
agricultural pursuits.”</p>

<p><i>Sex.</i>—The sexes differ as much in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
form of their hands as they do in the figure
of the skeleton, and in the general habit
and conformation of the entire body. As
Carus observes, “He must be but a superficial
observer of mankind who could not at
once recognise the sex from a simple inspection
of the hand. The hand of woman is
smaller, more delicate, and much more finely
articulated than that of man; it has a softer
palm, and joints which are but slightly prominent.
The hand of man, on the contrary,
is large, firm, and broad, is furnished with
strong projecting joints, and a hard wide
palm, together with a large thumb, with a
strong convex ball or root.” Here, again,
we find the physical structure in harmony
with the mental disposition—the firm,
strong, broad hand of man being indicative
of his active, energetic, reasoning mind;
and the soft, narrow, delicate hand of woman,
symbolical of her sensitive, yielding,
contemplative character.</p>

<p><i>Race.</i>—We have not yet obtained sufficient
data to enable us to ascertain any
thing very definite respecting this part of
our subject. Whether the hand of races<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
springing from the Caucasian stock presents
a form essentially different from that of
people originating from the Mongolian,—whether
the hand of the Negro races resembles
or differs from that of the American
tribes, must be determined by the future
investigations of intelligent and observing
travellers. From the few observations that
have hitherto been made, it would appear
that in the American and Mongolian races
the hand is characterised by a preponderance
of the motive element over the sensitive, the
member being large and coarse, with the
bones, muscles, and joints, strongly developed.
As regards the dark-coloured
races we know that they differ somewhat
from the white in the texture of their skin:
it is coarse in its structure, provided with a
larger number of sebaceous glands, and covered
by a thicker layer of cuticle, so that
the sentient terminations of the nerves being
less exposed its general sensibility must be
considerably less than that of the skin of
white people.</p>

<p>But the hand not only affords us characters
by which the age and sex may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
determined, it is likewise an index of the
general habit of body, of the kind of temperament,
and of the mental tendency and
disposition.</p>

<h3>HAND, INDEX OF HABIT OF BODY AND
TEMPERAMENT.</h3>

<p>The general habit of body, and the kind
of temperament, we determine from certain
general signs deduced from the hand. We
observe the structure of the skin—whether
it be fine or coarse in its texture, whether it
be hard and unyielding, or soft and elastic.
We note the quantity of fat and of cellular tissue;
and this enables us to form a judgment
respecting the degree of <em>embonpoint</em>, and we
have already abundantly proved that a man
of a soft, lax habit, with an abundance of
cellular and fatty tissues, differs in mental
tendency and disposition from one of firm,
tense fibre, in whom the bones, muscles, and
articulations, are strong and prominent.
Thus, a soft, thick hand, loaded with fat,
denotes little energy of character, and a soft,
yielding, inactive disposition; while, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
contrary, a thin, firm, bony, or muscular
hand indicates a rough, active, energetic
nature. With respect to the texture of the
skin—a hand possessing a delicate and
highly-sensitive skin is accompanied by
a similar structure of the tegumentary
envelope of the entire body, and is always
associated with an excitable organisation,
with a highly sensitive, mobile disposition.
A coarse, dry texture of the skin denotes a
preponderance of muscular force over sensibility,
and a character more remarkable for
solidity and resolution than for imagination
or vivacity of conception. The hand partakes
of the nature of the whole body; when
the latter is gracefully and symmetrically
formed, with its several parts in nice adaptation
and co-ordination, the former shares its
perfection and is constructed after the same
general plan; and we accordingly find that
a powerful, athletic individual is furnished
with a large hard hand, with its joints or
articulations strong and prominent, and a
delicate, sensitive person, with a small, narrow
hand, with its joints small and but
slightly prominent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<h3>HAND, FOUR PRIMARY FORMS OF, CONNECTED
WITH PARTICULAR MENTAL TENDENCIES.</h3>

<p>In order correctly to determine the more
particular signs of the mental disposition
which may be drawn from an examination of
the hand, we must first take into consideration
the special physiological functions of
the organ. On the one hand, it is the most
delicate instrument of feeling,—the organ of
touch, by means of which we judge of so
many properties of bodies; on the other
hand, the finest and most skilful instrument
of motion and of prehension; and it may
likewise be regarded as the organ of art.
A hand rather below the average size, and of
which the skin is soft and delicate, the
fingers long, and provided with numerous
cuticular ridges, which are indicative of a
large number of the sentient papillæ of touch,
the bony portion but slightly developed, and
the joints not prominent, is admirably adapted
for an organ of sensation, but by no means
suited for an instrument of motion; while,
on the contrary, a size rather above the
average, together with a massive, bony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
framework, strong muscles and tendons, and
large joints, are the characteristics of a powerful
instrument of prehension—of a hand
in which sensation is sacrificed to motion.</p>

<p>In the former case, we may with certainty
predicate a mind mobile, imaginative, and
inclined to abstraction,—a mind employed
chiefly on subjective phenomena; in the
latter, the mind is rather objective in its
action than subjective, operating powerfully
upon the external world, whether by arms,
agriculture, or the mechanical arts: the
former hand we term sensitive, the latter
motive.</p>

<p>In the highest and most perfect form of
hand, thin, delicate, conical fingers are combined
with a moderate-sized palm and a well-developed
thumb,—both the sensitive and
motive parts are in nice and accurate adaptation;
the instrument being thus rendered capable
of executing whatever the intellect may
desire: such a hand we term “psychical.”
In the lowest form of hand, the member retains
throughout adult life the character
which it presented in infancy, and it strikingly
resembles the hand of those of the monkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
tribe most nearly allied to man in their organisation
and outward form,—a hard, thick,
palm being joined to short, rudimentary
fingers: such a form of hand we style “elementary.”
It is mostly associated with a
crude, undeveloped state of the intellectual
powers. Thus, by tracing the normal developement
and the anatomy and physiology
of the hand, we have obtained four definite
types of formation founded upon anatomical
and physiological characters, and corresponding
to a certain extent to the temperaments,—the
psychical as the highest form,
the elementary as the lowest, and, as intermediate
forms, the sensitive and the
motive. The sensitive is characterised by
softness, delicacy, and a rounded form,—by
a member adapted by its structure for an accurate
discrimination of the external world,
and for a delicate organ of sensation; the
motive, by great developement of the muscular,
tendinous, and osseous structures,
and exercising its objective influence by
virtue of its active movements and its physical
force; the psychical uniting the perfections
of both the sensitive and the motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
types, the elementary without the excellencies
of either.</p>

<p>We pass on to a somewhat more detailed
examination of the several parts of the hand.
It may be considered as made up of the
palm, the thumb, and the fingers.</p>

<p><i>Palm.</i>—As regards the palm, we have to
notice its size, thickness, and degree of hardness;
its temperature, degree of dryness,
and the furrows by which it is marked. In
all the lower animals the palm is large,
thick, and hard. Hence D’Arpentigny
views the palm as indicative of the physical
appetites or animal propensities, and of the
degree and intensity of the mental affections
to which they give rise. Thus, when the
palm is narrow and thin, the temperament
is feeble, the imagination without force, and
the mind rather subtle than comprehensive;
when its size and thickness are in harmony
with the proportions of the thumb and
fingers, sensual impressions easily excite the
mind, but a salutary control is exercised by
reason and imagination; when it is large in
comparison with the fingers, sensuality and
egotism predominate; and lastly, when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
large, thick and hard, the animal faculties
preponderate over reason, and the passions,
unrefined by imagination, have full and uncontrolled
sway. A moist, warm, rosy palm
denotes health, youth, delicate sensibility,
and energy of the vegetative functions. Thus
Shakspeare in “Othello,” speaking of the
hand of Desdemona,—</p>

<p>In febrile diseases, the palm is hot and dry;
and the same obtains when the vegetative
functions are languid, or in exhaustion from
debauchery or other causes. As Shakspeare
has it in the “Twelfth Night,”—</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Maria.</i> Now, sir, thought is free: I pray you bring
Your hand to the buttery bar, and let it drink.</p>

<p><i>Sir Andrew Aguecheek.</i> Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s
your metaphor?</p>

<p><i>Maria.</i> It’s dry, sir.”</p></blockquote>

<p>According to the old chiroscopists, the life-line—that
is, the furrow at the line of de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>marcation
between the ball of the thumb and
the palm—measures by its length the term
of existence; it is certainly more strongly
marked in strong and healthy than in weak
and sickly persons. A pallid or yellowish
colour of the furrows marking the palm is
indicative of disease.</p>

<p><i>Thumb.</i>—The thumb deserves particular
notice in treating of the hand. It is the
presence of a thumb that imparts to the
hand of the higher animals its character of
superiority. It is the higher developement
and greater mobility of the human hand that
render it so much more perfect than that of
the ape: “L’animal supérieur est dans la
main, l’homme est dans la pouce,” says D’Arpentigny.
The thumb being, then, the characteristic
element of the human hand—the
part last developed and most strongly typical
of its superiority over that of the lower
animals, the perfect formation of this part
of the hand must be regarded as a sign of
the character of the species being well
marked,—of a strong, active individuality;
while the reverse obtains when it is small
and rudimentary. The ball of the thumb is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
made up of strong muscles, and in it the
motor function of the hand is, as it were,
concentrated. It is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mons Veneris</span> of the
old chiroscopists; the expression of “la volonté
raisonnée,” of decision, perception,
and the logical faculty, according to D’Arpentigny,
who confirms the old opinion above
alluded to, remarking, “Aimer c’est vouloir,
et vouloir c’est aimer.” Persons with a small
thumb are ruled by the heart, those with a
large by the head. The motive hand is
always furnished with a large thumb, and
hence, probably, the origin of the term, from
<em lang="it" xml:lang="it">domare</em>, to rule (Italian), <em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Daumen</em> (German);
power and objective force being imparted by
it to the hand.</p>

<p>The Romans applied the term <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pollex truncatus</em>
to a person who, for the purpose of
avoiding military service, cut off or mutilated
his thumb—hence our word <em>poltroon</em>. It
was by the position of the thumb that spectators
determined the fate of conquered gladiators;
if it were raised, life was spared, if
it were depressed, it was a sentence of death.
In the Anglo-Saxon laws, it is ordained that
mutilation of the thumb shall be punished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
a fine of twenty shillings, and that of the
middle finger by a fine of four only. In La
Vendée, a large thumb is still thought to be
indicative of a dabbler in the forbidden mysteries
of the black art. Biting the thumb
was formerly held to be expressive of insult
and defiance; thus Shakspeare in “Romeo
and Juliet,”—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">“<i>Samson.</i> I will bite my thumb at them; which is a<br />
disgrace to them if they bear it.”</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Fingers.</i>—Having fully examined the
palm and thumb, we have next to direct our
attention to the four fingers—to their length,
their general outline, the size of the joints,
and the shape of the pieces of which the
fingers are made up,—the phalanges, more
especially of the terminal one.</p>

<p>Prominent joints evince great development
of the bony and muscular structures of the
hand; they indicate a motive and prehensive
organ. Persons with such fingers, according
to D’Arpentigny, are remarkable for their
love of order and arrangement, for a mind
prone to analysis and reasoning, and for actions
regulated by the calm dictates of judgment,
and not impelled by the sudden inspi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>ration
of enthusiasm. Smooth, even fingers,
on the contrary, with a regular outline and
articulations but slightly prominent, denote
that the nervous system is more developed
than the bony and muscular, and that the
member is endowed with fine sensibility.
Such an individual will be more or less
swayed by imagination, will act rather from
the impulse of the moment than from reason
and experience, will be rather disposed to
view things as a whole than to consider in
detail their several parts,—in fact, will be furnished
with a mind with more of imagination
and synthetical talent than of reason or
logical ability. The joints become more distinctly
marked as age advances. In fine,
says D’Arpentigny, “Man becomes the more
orderly, the less credulous, and the more
logical, in proportion as the articular prominences
become more strongly defined.”</p>

<p>The last phalanx, or terminal piece of the
fingers, may terminate in either of three ways.
It may be rounded, cushiony, somewhat enlarged
as it were; it may be square and
flattened; or it may be delicate, tapering,
and conical. The enlarged, rounded, cush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>iony-terminated
phalanx, characterises “the
doigts en spatule” of D’Arpentigny, or, as
we shall term them, “sensitive fingers.” It
indicates a great number of the delicate papillæ
of touch, and serves to denote a sensitive
hand. The square terminal phalanx
mostly accompanies the motive and elementary
form of hand; and the tapering, conical
extremity, the psychical. It is a remarkable
fact, that among all nations the figures of
saints, angels, and divinities, should have
been invariably figured with delicate, tapering
fingers. The hands of witches, demons,
and sorcerers, have likewise been delineated
with elongated fingers; but they are rough,
thin, and bony, and armed with long nails
or claws, like the toes of the lower animals.</p>

<p><i>Nails.</i>—We must say a few words upon
the nails,—parts corresponding to the horny
skeleton of invertebrate animals. They are
sometimes long and narrow, as in the psychical
hand: sometimes short and broad, as in
the elementary type; and sometimes square
and strong, as in the motive, or they may be
brittle or thickened, or otherwise diseased.
In consumptive people they become curved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
somewhat claw-like. If the characters which
they furnish be in accordance with those
which are indicated by the other parts of the
hand, they are thereby doubly confirmed; if
the two differ, they mutually render each
other less positive. Thus an elementary
hand with long, slender nails, must be looked
upon as having a decided tendency to assume
a higher type of organisation, while if the
nails be broad and short like the fingers, the
signification is thereby the more confirmed.</p>

<h3>FORM OF HANDS.</h3>

<p>1.—<i>The Elementary Hand.</i> See <a href="#p1">Plate&nbsp;I.</a>—Fingers
thick, and without flexibility,
palm large, thick, and hard, thumb rudimentary,
and frequently bent somewhat
backwards, skin coarse in its texture, nails
short and thick. In countries where such
hands abound, the people obey habit and
instinct rather than reason. The sensations
are dull and inactive, the imagination is
without force, and the character apathetic;
for the extremities of the nerves being deficient
in sensibility, the impressions conveyed
to the brain are wanting in intensity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the ideas to which they give rise are consequently
neither clear nor vivid. “Aux
mains élémentaires, en Europe le labourage,
le soin des étables et la longue suite des
travaux grossiers auxquels suffisent les confuses
lumières de l’instinct. A elles la
guerre, en tant qu’il ne s’agit, que d’arroser
machinalement de la sueur un sol étranger.
Enfermées dans le monde matériel elles ne
se rattachent guêre à l’ensemble politique,
que par l’élément physique. Les convictions
se ferment en elles dans une sphère inaccessible
au raisonnement, et leurs vertus tiennent
le plus souvent à des facultés négatives.”</p>

<p>Elementary hands abound in the north of
Europe. The individuals characterised by
them are always superstitious; witness the
Lappes, the Finns, and the Icelanders. By
misfortune they are overwhelmed. In India,
where they do not naturally exist, they have
been artificially produced in a particular
caste—the Parias—by political and social institutions.
They have been abundant among
every people at the dawning of their civilisation;
they raised the pyramids in Egypt and
the Cyclopean structures in Italy, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
described as existing in a rude state of society
in the literature of various nations:
witness the Polyphemus of the Greeks, the
Melibœus of the Latins, the Caliban of
Shakspeare, and the Sancho Panza of Cervantes.
This form of hand can unquestionably
be produced by premature hard labour,
but it is found among the upper classes likewise,
where manual labour cannot be supposed
to have given rise to it. Physiologically
it must be looked upon as an arrest of
developement, its main bulk, like the member
of the lower animals and of the human
fœtus, being made up of the solid palm. It
must hence be regarded as a primitive form
of the member, as a rudimentary, and consequently
an imperfect organ.</p>

<p>Transitions from the elementary to other
forms of hand are frequently met with.
Thus, when the fingers become elongated
and somewhat thinner, and the texture of
the skin finer, the hand may be said to be
intermediate between the elementary and
sensitive type, while long, hard, bony fingers
indicate an approach towards the motive
type. And thus it is that intelligence is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
more readily to be attained by persons with
elementary, than a fine sensibility by those
furnished with a motive hand, or great
energy in objective action by those provided
with a sensitive.</p>

<p><i>2. The Sensitive Hand</i> (see <a href="#p2">Plate&nbsp;II.</a>)
is rather below than above the average size,
palm soft and narrow, fingers thin and delicate,
with the extremity plump, rounded, and
cushiony, thumb thin and small, skin fine
and very vascular, nails narrow and semi-transparent.
This type of hand may be
looked upon as essentially feminine. It denotes
a highly-sensitive frame, and a delicately-organised
nervous system. The nervous
ramifications distributed to the surface
of the body being covered only by a thin
layer of cuticle or scarf-skin, are easily excited
by impressions from without, and as
readily transmit their excitement to the central
organs, thus occasioning a prompt and
vivid flow of ideas.</p>

<p class="right"><a name="p2" id="p2">Plate 2.</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i083.jpg" width="400" height="454" alt="The Sensitive Hand." />
<p class="center">The Sensitive Hand.</p>
</div>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>The Artistic Hand</i> of D’Arpentigny
is a variety of this type. It is characterised
by a moderately-developed palm, long tapering
fingers, very flexible, and a small thumb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
It has for its object the worship of material
beauty, is disposed to view things through
a romantic medium, is fond of leisure, of
liberty, and of change; is at once bold and
timid, humble and vain, exalted and depressed,
enthusiastic and desponding. The
charms of a quiet, regulated, domestic life
possess but little attraction for such persons,
who, with much originality, have equal
fickleness of character. “En France nos
armées sont pleines de mains artistiques de
tout genre; elles leur doivent le caractère
de mobilité aventureuse, insouciante, pittoresque;
cet élan fulgurant et prime sautier,
qui les distinguent. Elles s’accommodent de
tout et sont propre à tout. On les enlève
par la parole.”</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) A gradual transition is afforded from
this to the motive type by means of <em>the
spathulate hand</em>, which partakes both of
the motive and sensitive character.</p>

<p><i>The spathulate hand</i>, when fully developed,
is furnished with smooth fingers, with
a rounded, cushiony termination, and a large
thumb. It denotes a love of corporeal movement,
and of active occupation—of horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
dogs, and field-sports; it prefers the useful
to the agreeable, and is not content, like the
elementary hand, with the merely necessary,
but demands abundance. It is distinguished
by an appearance of simplicity and frankness
of character, and likewise by its chastity; so
that Diana or Cyrus the Younger may be
said to be its representatives. It is a native
of the North, is more common in Scotland
than in England, in England than in France,
and in France than in Italy or Spain. Wherever
it is the prevailing type, as in England
and America, the political institutions are
free. It is essentially Protestant. “Amoureuses
de l’art, de la poésie, du roman, des
mystères, les mains pointues veulent un dieu
selon leur imagination; amoureuses des sciences
et de la réalité, les mains en spatule
veulent un dieu selon leur raison.” So
that it may be truly said that the people of
the north are physically Protestant, and those
of the south Catholic. It must also be remarked,
that before the revocation of the
Edict of Nantes the Protestants of France
were likewise its chief manufacturers; for
the same spirit that led them to embrace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Protestantism impelled them to the cultivation
of mechanical and scientific pursuits.
It prefers size and regularity to beauty,
opulence to luxury, and that which excites
astonishment to that which pleases. In
private life its motto is, “Chacun pour soi.”</p>

<p class="right"><a name="p3" id="p3">Plate 3.</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i086.jpg" width="400" height="476" alt="The Motive Hand." />
<p class="center">The Motive Hand.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Motive Hand</i> (see <a href="#p3">Plate&nbsp;III.</a>)—Above
the mean size, fingers with prominent joints,
of an average length, and strong, thick, and
bony, with a square tip; palm of a mean
size, hollow, and tolerably firm; thumb
large, with the muscular root strongly developed.
This form of hand cannot exist
without a strong, massive developement of
the bony and muscular system. It is essentially
the hand of man, as the sensitive is
that of woman. Hence, in the female sex,
it indicates a masculine energy of character:
witness the hardy peasants of Switzerland
and the Tyrol. In both sexes it denotes a
preponderance of the masculine or reasoning
mind over the imaginative faculties. Hence
it loves form and arrangement, possesses a
strong instinctive feeling for right and authority,
and a profound respect for established
forms; prefers an aristocracy to a demo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>cracy,
and the known to the unknown; takes
a delight in organising, in classifying, in
systematising, in subjecting thought to opinion,
and man to his fellow-man. Devoid
of originality, and with but little imagination,
it moves only in the old beaten path,
and its belief is limited to that which it is
capable of comprehending.</p>

<p>Partaking of the character of the motive
and psychical type, we have a mixed intermediate
form, termed by D’Arpentigny “the
philosophical hand.”</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) <i>The Philosophical Hand</i> is somewhat
smaller than the motive; the fingers have
large joints, and are somewhat tapering at
their tip; the palm is large and elastic, the
thumb also large, with its two phalanges
nearly equal in length. Such was the hand
of Locke, of Condillac, of Descartes, Malebranche,
and Leibnitz. It denotes a love
of absolute truth for its own sake, and of
speculations respecting the nature of life and
the origin of things. It adopts opinions only
upon a careful investigation, and reason is
its only recognised guide.</p>

<p class="right"><a name="p4" id="p4">Plate 4.</a></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i091.jpg" width="400" height="569" alt="The Psychical Hand." />
<p class="center">The Psychical Hand.</p>
</div>

<p><i>The Psychical Hand</i> (see Plate <a href="#p4">Plate&nbsp;IV.</a>) is at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
once the most beautiful and the most rare.
Compared with the stature it is small and
delicate; the fingers are thin, without articular
prominences, and long and tapering;
the palm is of average dimensions, the thumb
well formed and but of moderate size. Persons
with such a hand are led by ideality;
soul is for them every thing; great interests
alone move them; in religion and politics
they are tolerant. In literature, Milton,
Klopstock, and Göthe, are their representatives.
Loving the ideal and the sublime,
they oppose to the school of Voltaire and
Hume that of Lamartine and Chateaubriand.
Among the Greeks, Plato is their
type.</p>

<p>D’Arpentigny says of these hands: “Elles
attachent, elles ajoutent, aux œuvres du penseur,
comme l’artiste à l’œuvre de l’artisan
la beauté, l’idéalité; elles les dorent d’un
rayon de soleil, elles les élèvent sur un
piédestal, elles leur ouvrent le porte des
cœurs; l’âme, oubliée et laissée en arrière
par les mains philosophiques, est leur guide,—la
vérité dans l’amour, et la sublimité
leur but, et l’expansion leur moyen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>This form of hand is met with among all
classes of society, but is rarely the prevailing
one among any people. In Asia, it is
most common in India; and in Europe, in
Germany.</p>

<p>Thus to the spathulate and motive hands
appertain matter and reality, the useful and
necessary arts, the action and theory of
things, and the knowledge of facts; to the
sensitive and psychical hands the boundless
ideal world—the fine arts, sublime poetry,
and abstract intellectual philosophy.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
